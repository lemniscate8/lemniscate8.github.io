    Hi, I'm Tait Weicht!
    I'm a current Ph.D. candidate in applied mathematics at the University of California, Davis.
    My current research interests are in cryogenic electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography.
    I am exploring algorithms in applied algebraic geometry for the former and picking up some random matrix theory to
    apply to phase retrieval in the latter.
    While my software development is currently in Python, there's a special place in my
    heart for R.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interacting with students and helping them learn brings me a lot of joy.
    I am always looking to learn something new about teaching better.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to my professional activities I somehow find time to do some indoor bouldering, baking, and swimming.
    New hobbies constantly arise, but sticking with these for now.
