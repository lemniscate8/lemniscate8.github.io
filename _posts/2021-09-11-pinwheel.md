### Aperiodic Tilings

I've been fascinated by aperiodic tilings for a while now.
Aperiodic tilings fill the plane but lack some symmetries you usually expect in a tiling and have other weirder properties.
For example, the Penrose D3 tiling is made up of kite and dart shapes that could fit together to make a parallelogram.

When tiled under the rules that you are not allowed to make parallelograms these tiles, filling the plane create a non-repeating pattern.
So if you took a copy pattern, no matter how far you moved it, you could never find a spot where both line up perfectly, tile on top of tile.
This is very different than other tilings of the plane with, say, hexagons or squares where moving a square on top of another square or hexagon on hexagon is enough to ensure that the tilings match up.
Even stranger and counterintuitive to this non-repeating property is that any finite section of the Penrose tiling appears infinitely often throughout the tiling!
In some sense, a Penrose tiling is more than a simple sum of its parts.

### The Pinwheel

Another tiling and the one I'd like to analyze here is the Pinwheel tiling.
It's super simple to make using something called an inflation-dilation rule.
